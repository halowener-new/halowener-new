So i did a little research on christmas traditions and it turns out ghost stories were as much a part of christmas as they were halloween up until about the turn of the 20th century. Without further ado, here are my favourite halloween songs and rhymes i’m sharing when i do outreach this month. Listen to our best christmas music playlist too.</p>
