<p>I pour off the hot water then roll the eggs against the pot kind of hard to crack them at odd places then i add red food coloring to the water but i use warm water and let them set for about 30 minutes then i but them in into clean cold water for easier peeling and i use the little sweet. Put the eggs back into the hot water. Add mustard, mayonnaise, paprika, salt, and pepper to the yolks, and mix thoroughly. Fill a piping bag with the yolk mixture, and pipe into the empty egg whites. If you’re looking to jazz up a regular recipe this halloween, this one is perfect for you.</p>
