<p>Pelletier also wanted to make sure the candy was clean and safe for kids. “the candy slide can even be used by children. The husband and wife duo hit up the pvc pipe aisle at their local hardware store. On both stands, saw at a 20 degree angle to attach it to the pipe. Smell my feet give me something good to eat.</p>

<p>The candy slide is really just made out of pvc pipe and halloween decorations, and allows people at their door to distribute candy to kids from six feet away and directly into their bag, bucket or pillow case! Cover the outside of the pvc pipe with orange crepe paper. The lower edge should sit just outside of the pumpkin’s “mouth.” hold the other end of the chute and slide candy down it! The last step is to seal off the bottom openings in the junctions at either end of the slide pipe so the candy goes to the child’s waiting basket rather than slipping into the support legs. Their handy dandy “candy slide” is a diy project using some basic pvc pipes.</p>

<p>They used a long pvc pipe for the tube slide and several smaller pipes as a stand, decorating the construction with a spooky skeleton as a finishing touch. Grab a gutter, or a pvc pipe, a long cardboard box, or a poster mailing tube and you�re on your to touchless candy delivery. All it takes to make this slide is a variety of pvc pipe and connectors, and some paint and items to decorate it. The couple designed a candy slide that was two metres long, meaning they can deliver sweets to visiting children without coming into contact with them. It features a full skeleton figure holding the upper end of the long.</p>

Jaimie and jay brilliantly make the candy slide—which you can diy by watching this video—using pvc pipes, connectors, a hot glue gun, a hacksaw, scissors, and halloween decor. Pelletier also wanted to make sure the candy was clean and safe for kids. It features a full skeleton figure holding the upper end of the long.</p>
