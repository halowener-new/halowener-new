<p>But a first glance at the cast list or description will likely set you up for disappointment. Hubie�s voice was just ridiculous. Premiering on the streaming service on october 7, hubie halloween ranked in the #1 spot on netflix during its first two weeks of availability, which is an impressive feat on its own.
