<p>Gimme your best jumpscare myers build! After being unhooked or unhooking yourself, decisive strike will become active and usable for 40 / 50 / 60 seconds. I’ve never seen this…shape before. With michael you should wait for the best opportunity to pop tier 3 when two survivors are near each other. But more worrying, he comes with an apparent grasp of the hunt.</p>

<p>What perks should i use with michael myers? At tier 3, he moves faster and can down survivors with one hit. Dont be afraid to mix up perks and see what works for you best. However you will miss how effective it is to down a survivor when changed. I�ll start us off with what i�m using atm:</p>

<p>Gimme your best jumpscare myers build! We’ve weeded out the best so you don’t have to. The best teachable killer perks in dead by daylight are ruin, bbq and chilli, enduring, spirit fury, devour hope, nurse’s calling, pop goes the weasel, corrupt intervention, and save the best for last. The dlc is directly inspired by the horror cult classic halloween (1978) and features the primary antagonist and protagonist of the film. Michael myers or the shape is one of 22 killers currently featured indead by daylight.</p>
