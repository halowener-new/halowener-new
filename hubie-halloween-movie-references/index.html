<p>I love this movie, it might just be the numerous sandler movie references and easter eggs throughout, but it�s about damn time another great halloween movie came out. References to sex, horny, asexual, boners, penises, transsexuals and tramps; By far the best is ben stiller. Indeed, there were a number of references to his other movies, including from his heyday in the 1990s, when he won over many of his most dedicated fans. More than a passable holiday comedy, though hubie halloween succeeded in tapping into the tradition of sandler films.</p>
