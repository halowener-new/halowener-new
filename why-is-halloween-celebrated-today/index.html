<p>And celebrated till this day with so much fun and frolic. But it will definitely be different this year. However, some areas hold large community events. Halloween falls on october 31 because the ancient gaelic festival of samhain , considered the earliest known root of halloween, occurred on this day. Unlike other western holidays, halloween is celebrated mainly in the us and canada.</p>

<p>Why do we celebrate halloween? As with most holidays, however, halloween is celebrated because of traditions spanning centuries. Adults may celebrate by watching horror films, holding costume parties or creating haunted houses or graveyards. Grab your witches hat and broomstick, because the spookiest day of the year has finally arrived. Halloween’s origins can be traced back to the ancient celtic festival known as samhain, which was held on november 1 in contemporary calendars.</p>

<p>Halloween halloween halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on october 31, and halloween 2020 will occur on saturday, october 31. Halloween today in american society, marketing and mass media have helped transform halloween from its celtic origins. It marked a pivotal time of year when seasons changed, but, more importantly, observers also believed the boundary between this world and the next became especially thin at this time, enabling them to connect with the dead. It was believed that on that day, the souls of the dead returned to their homes, so people dressed in costumes and lit bonfires to ward off spirits. We celebrate it to mark the end of harvest.</p>
