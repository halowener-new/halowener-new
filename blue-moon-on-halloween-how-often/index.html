A blue moon will fall on halloween this year, making the spookiest night of the year just a little bit eerier. The next halloween full moon occurs this year! Since the moon’s period of phases is 29 ½ days, while months usually have 30 or 31 days, it’s obvious that if a full moon lands on the first day of any month except february, it will repeat again at the end.</p>
