<p>My family and friends are like to play online games a lot. Playing on zoom makes photo roulette way more fun because you can see everyone’s reactions to the photos. A cat, butterflies, monster, and beard mask! To play photo roulette you and your friends will have to download the app. But there’s even more to do over a zoom call besides catch up and share cool facts.</p>
